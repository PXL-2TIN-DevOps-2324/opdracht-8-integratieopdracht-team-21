# Integratieopdracht DevOps Oplossing

## a) 

**GitHub Actions and Docker Integration:**

GitHub Actions is utilized for implementing automation in deployment processes and continuous integration. This enables building and testing code with each commit. It also allows for automatic application of changes to both staging and production environments. By utilizing this tool, developers can focus more on writing code, while routine tasks are automated.

Docker simplifies the deployment of applications across various environments by encapsulating them in containers. These containers consist of the necessary software to run the application. Docker ensures isolation between applications, preventing interference. It also allows flexibility in determining the size of the app based on specific requirements.

## b)

**YAML Overview:**

YAML is a language for easily storing and structuring human-readable data. It is commonly used for creating configuration files where settings and parameters can be defined in an understandable manner. The syntax of YAML files is simple, allowing the creation of lists with square brackets [] and assigning values to keys using a colon ':' without the need for quotes or semicolons. For example:

```yaml
Groepsnaam: Team21
Leden:
- CÃ©dric
- Dietmar
- Wout
- Stef
```

## c)

**DockerHub:**

DockerHub is an open-source container registry designed for finding, using, and sharing container images. Developers can host public repositories for free use or private repositories for team and company collaboration.

## d)

**GitHub Actions Secrets:**

Secrets are used to secure sensitive information in the repository, preventing unauthorized access to DockerHub and the misuse of webhooks in other repositories. It ensures a more secure way of handling credentials, avoiding the exposure of usernames and access tokens directly in the YAML file.

## e)

**Azure Cloud Computing Platform:**

Azure is a cloud computing platform by Microsoft, providing various tools for deploying resources such as servers, VMs, and databases over the internet. It competes with AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Google Cloud. Azure offers **I**nfrastructure **a**s **a** **S**ervice (**IaaS**), **P**latform **a**s **a** **S**ervice (**PaaS**), and **S**oftware **a**s **a** **S**ervice (**SaaS**). Users pay for the resources they use without the need to own physical hardware.
